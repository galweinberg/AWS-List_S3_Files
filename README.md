# DevOps Assignment ‚Äì AWS  Project

This project defines and deploys a simple serverless application using **AWS CDK (Python)**. It uses **Lambda**, **S3**, and **SNS**, with all infrastructure managed as code and deployed through **GitHub Actions**.

***It is important to mention that without inserting AWS secret to GitHub, and also adding your email to secrets as `NOTIFY_EMAIL` , it will not work well.***

## üìÅ Contents (What‚Äôs Included)

- ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK in Python)
- ‚úÖ Lambda function to list S3 objects and send email via SNS
- ‚úÖ Lambda to upload sample files to S3 during deployment
- ‚úÖ `sample_files/` folder with sample S3 data
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Script for manually triggering the Lambda
- ‚úÖ This README with setup and instructions

  ***(all above are under devops_assignment in the project)***

- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
  
  ***(under .github/workflows)***

# Setup and Deployment

> You‚Äôll need AWS credentials (access key, secret, account ID) and an available email to deploy.

### 1. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g aws-cdk

### 2. Configure AWS Locally (optional, for manual deploy)

### In your console:

aws configure

Then enter:

- AWS Access Key ID

- AWS Secret Access Key

- Default region (e.g., us-east-1)

This allows you to use cdk bootstrap and cdk deploy locally.

### 3. Set Up GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repo:

- Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

- Click New repository secret

 Add the following secrets:


- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` ‚Äî Your access key ID
  
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` ‚Äî Your secret access key
  
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` ‚Äî Your 12-digit AWS Account ID  

These are required for the GitHub Actions deployment.



### 4. Replace SNS Email

In addition to AWS credentials, add the following GitHub secret:

- `NOTIFY_EMAIL` ‚Äî The email address to receive SNS notifications. Must be confirmed via email after deployment.

‚úÖ Important: After deployment, you will receive an email from AWS SNS ‚Äî click "Confirm subscription" to start receiving notifications.

### 5. Bootstrap CDK (first time only)

***cdk bootstrap***

### 6. Deploy manually

***cdk deploy***

this will

- Create the S3 bucket

- Upload files from sample_files/

- Deploy both Lambda functions

- Set up the SNS topic and subscription

## GitHub Actions CI/CD
The project includes a deployment workflow at .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

To run it:

### Only after adding the secrets to GitHub:

Trigger the deploy:

Go to the Actions tab

Select the Deploy workflow

Click Run workflow


# üîç Main AWS Components (Explanation)


## üîê IAM Role

The main Lambda function uses a dedicated IAM role with least-privilege permissions:

- Basic Lambda execution 

- Read access to the specific S3 bucket 

- Permission to publish messages to the SNS topic 

This is defined in the CDK.


## ü™£ Amazon S3
The stack creates a new versioned S3 bucket where files from sample_files/ are uploaded during deployment.


- Files are uploaded by the helper Lambda function

- Bucket is set to auto-delete on stack destruction (for testing/demo use)



## üìù AWS Lambda
There are two Lambda functions in the project:

### Main Lambda (main_lambda.py)

- Lists all objects in the S3 bucket

- Sends the object list via SNS email notification


### Helper Lambda (upload_files.py)

- Uploads local files from sample_files/ to the bucket at deployment time

- Triggered automatically using a CDK CustomResource

- Both functions are written in Python and defined as part of the CDK stack


## üì¨ SNS Subscription (Email)
SNS is used to send an email listing the files in the S3 bucket.

it should look like that:

### Remember to update the email as a secret and confirm the subscription when prompted by AWS.



## üìÇ Files Uploaded to S3 on Deploy
During deployment, a helper Lambda (upload_files.py) uploads everything in the sample_files/ folder to the S3 bucket.

Examples:

checkcheck.txt

heyWorld.txt

This runs automatically during cdk deploy.

## Manual Lambda Trigger (Test)
You can test the main Lambda manually using the provided script.
***in the project - under tests/test_trigger_lambda***

### Option 1: Python + Boto3

python tests/test_trigger_lambda.py
This invokes the Lambda named ListS3Lambda and prints the list of S3 objects.

### Option 2: AWS CLI

aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name ListS3Lambda \
  --payload '{}' \
  response.json

## ‚úÖ Checklist: Assignment Requirements
- Deliverable	Status
- GitHub repo with CDK IaC	‚úÖ
- Lambda function to list S3 + send SNS	‚úÖ
- SNS topic with email subscription	‚úÖ 
- Upload files to S3 during deploy	‚úÖ
- GitHub Actions workflow for deployment	‚úÖ
- Manual Lambda trigger method (script)	‚úÖ
- README with all required sections	‚úÖ

### Notes
All secrets are handled via GitHub Secrets ‚Äî none are committed to the repo.

SNS requires email confirmation after first deploy.

This project is designed to work with the AWS Free Tier.
